# S3-bucket-creation-with-Terraform

In this project I will be creating an S3 bucket using Terraform by Hashicorp to demonstrate my knowledge using IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and applying the conceptual practice onto real-world based scenarios to fully prove my skills in this technology. The provider that I will be using for this hands-on practice will be AWS (Amazon Web Services) and I will be explaining the process thoroughly on how to set up an S3 bucket in a cloud environment.
